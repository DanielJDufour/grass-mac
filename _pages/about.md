My interests center around long-term human ecology and landscape dynamics with ongoing projects in the Mediterranean (late Pleistocene through mid-Holocene) and prior work in the American Southwest (Holocene-Archaic). I've done fieldwork in Spain, Bosnia, and various locales in North America and have expertise in hunter/gatherer and early farming societies, geoarchaeology, lithic technology, and evolutionary theory, with an emphasis on human/environmental interaction, landscape dynamics, and techno-economic change. Quantitative and computational methods are critical to archaeological research, and socioecological sciences in general. They are an important focus of my research, especially emphasizing dynamic modeling, spatial technologies (including GIS and remote sensing), data science, and visualization.

I am an advocate for open, transparent science. As Director of [CoMSES.Net](http://comses.net ) and the [Open Modeling Foundation](https://openmodelingfoundation.org), I promote open scientific computation for social and ecological sciences. I am also member of the GRASS GIS international development team and Project Steering Committee that is making cutting edge spatial technologies available to researchers and students around the world. To help in this effort, I maintain GRASS binary apps for the Macintosh OS at this web site.
