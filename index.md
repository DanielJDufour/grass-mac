# Fully bundled Mac apps of current GRASS releases##

These apps are fully 64 bit applications and include all needed helper programs (dependencies), including Python (version 2.7.x for older binaries and version 3.6 and above for GRASS versions 7.8 and higher) and wxPython (versions 3 and 4). They should work 'out of the box' without any separate "frameworks" being installed, and should work with System Integrity Protection enabled (the default for the Mac - see below).

If you are not familiar with ***GRASS GIS***, you should visit the **[ main GRASS site](http://grass.osgeo.org)** and community maintained **[GRASS WIKI](http://grass.osgeo.org/wiki/)** to take a look at its features. Used throughout the world, GRASS is one of the most powerful and comprehensive geospatial analysis, visualization, and modeling tools available. In continuous use and development for over three decades, GRASS is one of the most mature GIS programs in active use and development ....and it is freely available to all. 

As open source software, the code and all analytical algorithms can be scrutinized and improved. It is developed and maintained by an international team of geospatial scientists who also use the software in their daily work. GRASS is a founding member of the **[*http://osgeo.org OSGeo Foundation]** (Open-Source Geospatial), an umbrella organization that provides a diversity of open-source software solutions for geospatial research, mapping, and interactive use. 
 
In addition to the Mac, GRASS runs under Linux, Unix, and Windows. Versions for these other platforms can be found at the **[downloads page](http://grass.osgeo.org/download/)** of GRASS main site. There is a very active **[*https://grass.osgeo.org/about/community/ GRASS community]** where you can have questions answered, as well as extensive **[*https://grass.osgeo.org/learn/ help online]** and built into the program itself.
