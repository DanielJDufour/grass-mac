I just posted new preview builds of GRASS 8.3.2 release candidate 1. There are a number of bug fixes and enhancements of course.

Thanks to Nicklas Larsson, the newest ARM build no longer needs Rosetta (Intel processor emulator) to launch. As a fully ARM native app, it also runs significantly faster than before.

We remain on track for releasing GRASS 8.3.2 in the next month and hopefully 8.4.0 by April.
