GRASS 8.4.0 RC1 was release a few days ago. I've posted new binaries for both Apple ARM and Intel processors. Information on enhancements and fixes can be found at: [https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/releases](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/releases)

We are moving toward a final v. 8.4.0 stable release soon. Enjoy!
