I just posted new GRASS 8.4 preview builds. There are a number of bug fixes and enhancements.

One enhancement to note is the addition of easy access to GRASS command history. There is a new history tab in the righ-most window (where the console is located). This allows you to easily repeat (or modify and repeat) a process you did in the past. This history enhancement is under development and will be further modified. But you can try it out now.

FYI, we are moving toward releasing GRASS 8.3.2 in the next month or so and hopefully 8.4.0 by April.
