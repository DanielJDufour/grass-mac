Two major bugs were recently identified in GRASS 8.3.0 affecting r.watershed and the Cartographic Composer. These have both been fixed and we are working to test and release an updated version 8.3.1 soon. In the meantime, I compiled a new version 8.4 preview with both bugs fixed. 

A remaining issue in version 8.4 to be aware of is that if you open a workspace created in an earlier version, it will show up with a display window disconnected from the main single window interface.
