GRASS team members from four U.S. universities have been awarded a prestigious grant (award 2303651) from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) to bolster and broaden the software ecosystem of GRASS GIS. See the overview [here](https://grass.osgeo.org/news/2023_09_06_nsf_grant_awarded/). The universities awarded the grant are:
- *North Carolina State University* (Helena Mitasova, Vaclav (Vashek) Petras, Anna Petrasova)
