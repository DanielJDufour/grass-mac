I have migrated the GRASS for Macintosh site from the Wikidot platform to GitHub to make it more sustainable, reliable and flexible for the future. In many respects, this site is identical to the one hosted on Wikidot. The main difference is that this does not have a forum that you must request joining. Instead, I will continue to provide announcements about releases and other information of relevance to GRASS users on Macintosh platforms, with a comments section where you can respond or ask questions. This will make it easier for more Mac users to benefit from this site and also make it easier for me to maintain. So welcome and enjoy!
