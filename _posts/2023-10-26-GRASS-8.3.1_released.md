GRASS 8.3.1 has been released, fixing two major bugs were recently identified in GRASS 8.3.0 affecting r.watershed and the Cartographic Composer. These have both been fixed. This version also has additional bug fixes and enhancements. See the announcement on the [GRASS News](https://grass.osgeo.org/news/) site for more information.

I compiled builds for the Mac legacy Intel 86 processors as well as the new ARM processors. It should run on MacOS 10 and above. The ARM build runs on MacOS 13 (Ventura) and above.

If you have installed MacOS 14 (Sonoma) and have any problems with the ARM build, you might try a test Sonoma-only build [here](http://download.osgeo.org/grass/mac/grass-8.3.1-sonoma-arm64.dmg). If you try it, please let me know in the comments if this works better than the Ventura build.
