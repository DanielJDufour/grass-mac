GRASS 8.4.0 was release a few days ago. I've posted new binaries for both Apple ARM and Intel processors.

A couple of improvements I especially want to note. A new GUI tools allows you to see and access a history of all of the commands you've issued (through the GUI or console) to modify and reuse them. This should simplify repetitive tasks. An important change in GRASS terminology now shows up in the GUI. The legacy term "location" referred to a folder/directory which stored the projection and coordinate reference system (CRS) for a set of maps, along with the folders/directories in which groups of maps are stored ("mapsets"). A confusing term for new users, "location" is now being replaced by the term "project".

 Enjoy!
